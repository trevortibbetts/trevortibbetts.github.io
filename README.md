## Welcome to my super cool github website. 
This is a learning enviroment where I can show off my new github/git skills
### Data Science Book
I have selected the book, *Fundamental Numerical Methods and Data Analysis* by George W. Collins, as a book of interest. It is hosted [here](https://ads.harvard.edu/books/1990fnmd.book/Bookfrnt.pdf) through Harvard University. I am still new to the field of data analysis and I thought a book labeled beginner would best suit me. This book goes over different statistics and tests to perform on data. It should give me a foundation for this quantitative field. 

### Selected Dataset:
I am interested in election result data. For my Master's thesis I will be researching spatial electoral polarization. This is using election data to quantify polarization between the two dominate political parties in the United States. I want to extend this research in spatial polarization to redraw congressional districts. I have a goal of gerrymandering the maps to draw them completely spatialy polarized, completely non-polarized, and a happy medium between the two. I will use this [dataset](https://github.com/21MetcalfJ/2024Precincts), found on github that contains all the election results from every precinct in the United States ~177,000, and perhaps 2020 Census data to conduct my analysis.
